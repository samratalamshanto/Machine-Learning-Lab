# Machine-Learning-Lab

There was a custom grade marks dataset of the 4th year students of the CSE Department of KUET. Using this dataset and machine learning algorithms, we try to predict the grade class( High(CGPA>3.50), Low(CGPA<3.00) and others are in Middle Class).

1. Artificial neural networks (ANN) from scratch on mnist 784 dataset (2 hidden layers)
2. Grade Marks Prediction Using Decision Tree and KNN
